This folder is empty in the repo.  
Use this location to store all the data when you run this locally.  
  
We are using the [small MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/#:~:text=Small%3A%20100%2C000%20ratings%20and%203%2C600%20tag%20applications)  - download, unzip into this folder.  
  
Your data should now be located at:
```./data/ml-latest-small/```  
  
The notebooks will assume this is where the data is located.
